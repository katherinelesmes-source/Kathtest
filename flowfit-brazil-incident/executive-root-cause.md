# Root Cause — Executive Summary

On March 11, a misconfiguration caused FlowFit's recurring subscription transactions to be submitted to card issuers as first-time, cardholder-initiated purchases — incorrectly flagging three interdependent fields (`transaction_type`, `initiator`, and `stored_credential_usage`) in a way that implied no prior payment consent existed on file. This misconfiguration became critical because GlobalPay completed a compliance infrastructure upgrade in Brazil on March 10, which began strictly enforcing the EMVCo Stored Credential Framework — meaning transactions that were previously accepted despite loose metadata were now being actively rejected. The evidence is unambiguous: decline code 57 ("Transaction not permitted to cardholder") surged from under 10% to 48.9% of all declines, all major Brazilian issuers were affected equally — ruling out any issuer-specific or fraud-related cause — and LatinAcquire, which has not yet enforced the same compliance rules, continued authorizing at 79.2% versus GlobalPay's 66.8%. The impact is isolated to Brazil because GlobalPay's upgrade was scoped to their Brazilian infrastructure, leaving other regions unaffected. The decline began precisely on March 11 — one day after the GlobalPay upgrade — because that is when the misconfigured metadata first collided with the new, stricter validation rules, converting a latent configuration error into an active authorization failure.
