# Key Message #2 — Live Presentation
## "We are already recovering your revenue — action started before this meeting."

---

Before we sat down today, we had already rerouted your Brazil transactions to a secondary processor that is performing 12 points better than your primary. That means every subscription charge running through Brazil right now is being authorized at a higher rate than it was yesterday. No code change, no waiting for a deployment — a routing decision we made on your behalf the moment we identified the issue.

The configuration fix that resolves the root cause is underway and will be confirmed within 48 hours. Once that is in place, your authorization rates return to where they were before March 11 — around 84%.

And here is what matters most for your financials: the transactions that were declined between March 11 and today are not written off. We are preparing a targeted retry campaign for those transactions using the corrected configuration. Based on the type of declines we saw, we expect to recover between 40 and 60 percent of those failed charges.

So when you leave this meeting, the situation is this — your payments are already performing better than when you walked in, a permanent fix is 48 hours away, and a portion of the revenue from the affected period is coming back.
