**Subject:** Brazil Payment Performance — Update & Recovery Plan

---

Hi [Name],

I want to give you a direct update on the payment performance issue we identified in Brazil, and more importantly, what we are doing to recover revenue as quickly as possible.

Between March 11–15, authorization rates in Brazil dropped from 84% to 67%. We have identified the exact cause — a configuration error in how transactions were being submitted to your payment processor — and the fix is clearly defined and already underway.

To be clear: this was not a fraud issue, not a problem with your customers' cards, and not a sign of broader business risk. It was a technical misconfiguration that we have isolated and are correcting.

Here is what is happening right now:

- We have already rerouted your Brazil transactions to a better-performing processor, which is recovering authorization rates immediately.
- The underlying configuration is being corrected to restore full performance within 48 hours.
- Once fixed, we will reprocess the declined transactions from the affected period to recover as much lost revenue as possible.

Brazil represents 36% of your volume, so restoring performance here is our highest priority. We will keep you updated at every step and share a full summary once the fix is confirmed stable.

Please don't hesitate to reach out directly if you have questions.

Best regards,
[Your name]
